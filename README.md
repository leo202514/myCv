## Technologies Used

  - **HTML5**: The core markup language for structuring the content of all web pages (Home, Gallery, Projects, Contact).
  - **CSS3**: For styling and layout, defining the visual presentation of the website.
  - **SCSS (Sass)**: Used as a CSS pre-processor to enable more organized and maintainable stylesheets through variables and nested rules (compiled into `style.css`).
  - **Font Awesome**: Integrated for scalable vector icons, used for social media links and project links.
  - **JavaScript**: (Though not directly provided in the snippets, `script.js` is referenced in HTML, implying potential interactive elements).

## Installation

To get a local copy of this project up and running, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-cv-website.git
    ```
    (Note: Replace `your-username/your-cv-website.git` with the actual repository URL if you have it hosted on GitHub.)
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd your-cv-website
    ```
3.  **Install Sass (if you plan to modify SCSS)**:
    If you wish to make changes to the styling defined in `style.scss`, you will need Sass installed to compile it to `style.css`.
    ```bash
    npm install -g sass
    # or using yarn
    yarn global add sass
    ```

## Usage

After installation, you can view the website locally.

1.  **Compile SCSS to CSS (if you made changes to `style.scss`)**:
    If you've modified `style.scss` or if `style.css` is not present, you'll need to compile it. Open your terminal in the project root and run:
    ```bash
    sass style.scss css/style.css
    ```
    For continuous development, use the watch command:
    ```bash
    sass --watch style.scss:css/style.css
    ```
2.  **Open the HTML files**:
    Simply open `index.html` in your web browser. You can navigate to other pages (`gallery.html`, `projects.html`, `contact.html`) using the navigation links within the site.
