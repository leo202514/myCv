        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I currently manage a diverse farm with a primary concentration on sheep production and feed cultivation. In
          addition I
          also manage olive groves, apricot orchards and spring onion cultivated for seed.I also do construction work if
          and when
          the opportunity arises.</p>
        <p>Beyond agricultural and construction operations, I dabble in bladsmithing and leather crafting.
          I have a passion for creating functional and aesthetically pleasing items, whether it's a custom knife or a
          leather wallet.
          My diverse skill set allows me to approach challenges with creativity and practicality.
        </p>
        <p>Currently, I am focused on expanding my knowledge in web development and coding, with the goal of creating
          some
          projects that has been on my mind for years.
          I am eager to learn and grow in this field, and I am excited about the possibilities.
